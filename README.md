Proof of listening

Problem: Podcasters and vloggers want better engage with their communities (this can be applied to highly specific healthcare videos focused on patient education)

Solution: Create platform for content creators to create short quizzes based on episodes and if listeners answer quiz questions correctly, they receive a NFT. 

Extra: Limit 5 NFTs per episode so the first 5 people who answer correctly win the NFT. How will we prevent the same person from submitting the answers 5 times? Maybe only 1 NFT per episode. Owning 10 NFTs can be redeemed for a t-shirt or something so they have some monetary value

Sponsor Tools Used: Unlock, Livepeer, IPFS
